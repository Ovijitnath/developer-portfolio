                Bangladesh.During
                the course of my academic career, I had the privilege of working with the several organizations in my
                free
                time, where I learned valuable professional skills such as software development, data analysis,
                configuration management, and data communication systems as well handling softwares. In my academic
                life, I
                have been consistently praised as hard-working by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic,
                extracurricular or professional projects, I apply proven technical, service and teamwork skills which I
                hope
                to leverage into the Cash(male)at your company.After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I
                am
                the type of component and competitive candidate you are looking for. I look forward to elaborating on
                how my
                specific skills and abilities will benefit your organization.
